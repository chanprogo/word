/ɝ/ : The /ɝ/ sound is sometimes written /ər/. This is the sound in a stressed syllable or a one syllable word. When /ɝ/ is unstressed it is written /ɚ/. In British English /ɝ/ is pronounced as /ɜ:/.

/ɚ/ : The /ɚ/ sound is the same as /ɝ/ except that /ɚ/ is used for unstressed syllables. It is sometimes also written as /ər/. In British English /ɚ/ is pronounced as /ə/.

/ʌ/ : This is a different sound than /ɑ/. The difference is not so much one of long and short, but of a different position of the mouth and tongue. Note that it is also pronounced somewhat differently than the British sound that is also usually written /ʌ/. When this sound is in an unstressed syllable it is written /ə/.

/ə/ : The vowel /ə/ is the most common sound in American English because of its use in unstressed syllables and words. It is called a schwa. when this sound is in a stressed syllable it is written /ʌ/.

---
/ɑ/ : Also written as /ɑ:/ in British English. Note that this is a very different sound than /ʌ/ in American English.


/ɔr/ : The ɔ used in /ɔr/ is not the same sound as the /ɔ/ in this app.(This is because the /ɔ/ used to describe many American Englsih words should be written /ɒ/.) The /ɔr/ sound begins with small rounded lips. It is pronounced as /ɔ:/ in British English. 

/ɔ/ : This sound should be written /ɒ/ according to IPA. However, to be consistent with most dictionaries, /ɔ/ is used here. Note, though, that it is not the same sound  as when /ɔ:/ is used to describe British pronunciation. 

---

/ʊ/ : Sometimes it is written incorrectly as /u/, but it should be written /ʊ/ (without the tail). /u/ and /ʊ/ are two very different vowels.
