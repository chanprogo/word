/aɪ/ : This is a diphthong, a combination of the /a/ and /ɪ/ sounds. Note the difference from /æ/.

/eɪ/ : This is a diphthong, a combination of the /e/ and /ɪ/ sounds. It is sometimes also written as /e/ in some American English dictionaries. (Do not confuse this with the British English symbol /e/, which is actually pronounced /ɛ/.) Words with the American English /eɪ/ sound are pronounced /ɛɪ/ in British English. However, they still write it as /eɪ/.

/aʊ/ : This is a diphthong, a combination of the /a/ and /ʊ/ sounds. Note the difference from /ɔ/.

/oʊ/ : This is a diphthong, a combination of the /o/ and /ʊ/ sounds. Note that there is a slight difference from the British pronunciation of /əʊ/.

/ɔɪ/ : The  ɔ used in  /ɔɪ/ is not the same sound as the /ɔ/ in this app.(This is because the /ɔ/ used to describe many American English words should actually be written /ɒ/.) The /ɔɪ/ sound begins with small rounded lips.

---
/ɛr/ : The /ɛr/ sound is more correctly written /ɛɚ/ according to IPA. It is pronounced and written as /eə/ in British English.

/ɪr/ :  The /ɪr/ sound is more correctly written /ɪɚ/ according to IPA. It is pronounced as /ɪə/ in British English.
